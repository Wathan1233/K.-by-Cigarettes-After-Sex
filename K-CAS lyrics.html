                I remember when I first noticed that you liked me back
                We were sitting down in a restaurant waiting for the check
                We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached
                But I could tell that something had changed how you looked at me then
                Kristen, come right back
                I've been waiting for you
                To slip back in bed
                When you light the candle
                And on the Lower East Side, you're dancing with me now
                And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall
                Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe
                Think I like you best when you're just with me
                And no one else
                Kristen, come right back
                I've been waiting for you
                To slip back in bed
                When you light the candle
                And I'm kissing you lying in my room
                Holding you until you fall asleep
                And it's just as good as I knew it would be
                Stay with me, I don't want you to leave
                Kristen, come right back
                I've been waiting for you
                To slip back in bed
                When you light the candle
